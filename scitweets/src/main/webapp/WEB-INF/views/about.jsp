				Our Mission</h2>

		<blockquote>
			<p style="font-family: Avant garde; font-size: 20px; color: #FFFFFF">
				SciTweets aims to make scientific research accessible to everyone
				for free. Through our News Engine, we analyze entire twitter feeds
				from many research institutions and organizations, and present their
				current research in a simple interface that is easy to operate. We
				eliminate the barriers towards accessing current scientific
				research, namely, the cost of paid-subscriptions and the need to use
				many different platforms to view the research. <br> <br>
				By presenting the latest happenings in the scientific world, we
				provide a platform where you can casually read scientific news,
				translate textbook reading into real world action, or become exposed
				to real world science. Through our Blog, we take the complicated
				research articles, and break them into digestable bits that are easy
				to understand.

				The Advantage of Using SciTweets</h3>
		</center>
		<p style="font-family: Avant garde; font-size: 20px; color: #FFFFFF">Most
			science textbooks typically are filled with concepts but lack real
			world experiments showing those concepts in action. When experiments
			are discussed in these textbooks, they are out of date.To augment
			your learning experience, and show you the theoretical concepts in
			action, the SciTweets News Engine serves as a freely accessible
			catalog of up-to-date research experiments. Through our Blog site, we
			present these current research articles in a easy to understand way
			suitable for non-technical people as well! SciTweets is the perfect
			destination whether you want to learn more about science, see
			theoretical principles in action, or casually scroll through
			articles.</p>
